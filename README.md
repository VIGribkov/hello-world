# hello-world
I'm new to github, I'm not a wizard - I'm just learning.
- 👋 Hi, I’m Vladimir Ivanivich Gribkov (@VIGribkov) from Siberia.
- 👀 I’m interested in python and machine learning.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning git, python, pandas, algorithms methods and many others.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate with anything since I am only hatching an idea 
how can mathematics and computer science serve to build a fair society 
that excludes exploitation in all spheres of life. My project is named 'communis_math'. 

I've been teaching math for 37 years now. I ask my students what the most important subject is, and they answer - mathematics. What I always object to them-that's not guessed: the main subject is social studies. Whatever a person does, all his activities should be aimed at the full development of society - the development of all members of society and the improvement of their well-being. The main word here is-all!

Thus, all projects must be directed towards this goal, otherwise, this activity is empty, transitory. Everything that does not develop society destroys it.
    
I would like to understand how mathematics and computer science can serve this noble purpose, to what extent such activities are already present in the world.
